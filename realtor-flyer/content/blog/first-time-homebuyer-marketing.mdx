First-time homebuyers represent one of the largest buyer segments in Ontario's real estate market. Yet many agents struggle to connect with Millennial and Gen Z buyers who research differently, communicate differently, and have unique concerns. Mastering **first-time homebuyer marketing** means meeting these buyers where they are—and speaking to what actually matters to them.

In 2025, first-time buyers are facing unprecedented challenges: high prices, interest rate uncertainty, and fierce competition. The agents who succeed with this demographic are those who provide genuine value, education, and guidance through what feels like an impossible process.
