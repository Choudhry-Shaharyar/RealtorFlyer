The debate between digital and print **real estate marketing in Canada** isn't really about choosing one over the other—it's about understanding when each channel works best and how to integrate them into a cohesive strategy.

Top-producing Canadian agents use both, but they're strategic about where they invest their marketing dollars. Let's break down the real costs, effectiveness, and best practices for each approach.

## The Canadian Marketing Landscape

### Digital Adoption Rates

According to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), over 90% of Canadian home buyers start their search online. But here's what's interesting: that same data shows that referrals and personal connections remain the #1 source for finding an agent.

This means digital builds awareness, but relationships close deals.

### Print's Surprising Resilience

Despite digital dominance, print marketing remains effective in Canada, particularly:
- Established neighbourhoods with older demographics
- Luxury markets where quality impression matters
- Neighbourhood farming campaigns
- Pre-listing preparation

## The True Cost Comparison

### Cost Per Impression

| Channel | Cost Per 1,000 Impressions |
|:---|:---|
| Facebook Ads | $5-20 |
| Instagram Ads | $8-25 |
| Google Display | $10-30 |
| Direct Mail | $450-550 |
| Door Hangers | $300-500 |

At first glance, digital wins on cost efficiency. But impressions aren't everything...

### Cost Per Quality Interaction

| Channel | Cost Per Meaningful Engagement |
|:---|:---|
| Social Media | $1-5 (via interactions) |
| Email | $0.50-2 (via opens/clicks) |
| Direct Mail | $10-25 (via calls, responses) |
| Door Knocking | $5-15 (per conversation) |

When you factor in quality of engagement, the gap narrows.

### Cost Per Transaction

The ultimate measure is deals closed. Based on Canadian agent surveys:

| Source | Cost Per Closed Transaction |
|:---|:---|
| Referral | $200-500 (client appreciation costs) |
| Farming (print) | $1,500-4,000 |
| Digital Ads | $2,000-8,000 |
| Paid Leads | $3,000-10,000 |

Referrals remain the most cost-effective source—but referrals come from relationships, and relationships are built through marketing touchpoints.

## When to Use Print vs. Digital

### Use Print When:

- **Neighbourhood farming**: Physical presence matters
- **Just sold follow-up**: Tangible proof works
- **Luxury marketing**: Quality impression counts
- **Older demographics**: 55+ respond better to mail
- **Local credibility**: "I saw your sign/postcard" matters
- **Offline-first clients**: Not everyone is on Instagram

### Use Digital When:

- **Reaching younger buyers**: Under 40 prefer digital
- **Immediate promotion**: Speed to market matters
- **Budget constraints**: Lower entry cost
- **Condo marketing**: Digital-native demographics
- **Testing messages**: Quick iteration and learning
- **Building web presence**: Long-term credibility

## The Integrated Approach: Best Practices

### Example: Launching a New Listing

**Day 0**: Coming soon email to database + social media tease
**Day 1**: MLS active + full social media campaign
**Day 2**: Just listed postcards printed and dropped to neighbours
**Day 3**: Google/Facebook ad campaign live
**Day 7**: Organic social content featuring the property
**Open House**: Feature sheets printed, signage deployed, Instagram stories live

### Example: Neighbourhood Farming

**Monthly Print:**
- Just sold postcards (when applicable)
- Quarterly market update newsletter
- Annual calendar or specialty item

**Ongoing Digital:**
- Weekly social posts about the neighbourhood
- Monthly email to local subscribers
- Regular Google Business Profile updates

**Periodic In-Person:**
- Quarterly door-knock sessions
- Community event attendance
- Local business partnerships

## Measuring What Works

### Digital Metrics to Track

- Website traffic by source
- Social media engagement rate
- Email open and click rates
- Ad cost per lead
- Conversion rates by channel

### Print Metrics to Track

- Call tracking numbers on mailers
- QR code scans
- "How did you hear about us?" responses
- Listing appointments from farm areas
- Year-over-year farm market share

## The Bottom Line for Canadian Agents

The digital vs. print debate is a false dichotomy. The most successful Canadian agents:

1. **Use digital for reach and awareness**
2. **Use print for credibility and farming**
3. **Integrate both into cohesive campaigns**
4. **Measure results and adjust allocations**
5. **Automate creation to maximize output**

The real constraint isn't choosing a channel—it's producing enough quality content across channels consistently.
