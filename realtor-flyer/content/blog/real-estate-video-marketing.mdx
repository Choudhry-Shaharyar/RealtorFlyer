Video isn't optional for real estate anymore—it's expected. **Real estate video marketing** has become the difference between listings that attract showings and those that sit. In 2025, Ontario buyers expect to virtually "walk through" properties before scheduling in-person visits, and agents who deliver this experience win more clients.

The good news: you don't need a Hollywood budget to create effective listing videos. From smartphone tours to professional productions, there's a video strategy for every listing and every budget.

## Why Video Dominates Real Estate Marketing

### The Numbers

| Content Type | Engagement vs. Photos |
|:---|:---|
| Listing Video | +403% more inquiries |
| Virtual Tour | +87% more qualified leads |
| Agent Video | +72% brand recall |
| Social Video | +1200% more shares |

Video consistently outperforms static imagery across every metric that matters.

### How Buyers Use Video

1. **Pre-screening**: Eliminate properties without visiting
2. **Remote buying**: Especially for relocation clients
3. **Sharing**: Send to partners, family, advisors
4. **Revisiting**: Review details after in-person showing
5. **Comparison**: Watch multiple properties back-to-back

> 73% of sellers say they're more likely to list with an agent who uses video marketing.
