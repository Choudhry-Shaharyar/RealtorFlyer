The next great wealth transfer in real estate is happening now. Baby boomers are sitting on $2+ trillion in Canadian home equity, and many are ready to trade their family homes for simpler, more manageable living. **Downsizer marketing** requires understanding a unique client who is often selling their most valuable asset and making a profound lifestyle change.

For Ontario agents, downsizers represent double transactions: selling the family home and buying the next chapter. Master this market, and you'll build a sustainable business serving clients who often have flexibility, equity, and referral networks.

## Understanding the Downsizer Client

### Demographics

| Factor | Typical Downsizer Profile |
|:---|:---|
| Age | 55-75 |
| Homeownership | 30+ years in current home |
| Equity Position | $500K-2M+ |
| Motivation | Lifestyle, not necessity |
| Timeline | Flexible (6-24 months) |

### Why They're Downsizing

**Push Factors** (leaving the family home):
- Too much space to maintain
- Property taxes and carrying costs
- Stairs and accessibility concerns
- Neighbourhood has changed
- Want to unlock equity

**Pull Factors** (toward new lifestyle):
- Lock-and-leave convenience
- Travel and leisure time
- Proximity to grandchildren
- Urban walkability
- Resort-style amenities

### The Emotional Journey

Unlike other clients, downsizers often experience:
- **Grief**: Leaving memories and community
- **Overwhelm**: Decades of possessions to sort
- **Anxiety**: Unknown next chapter
- **Excitement**: New possibilities
- **Relief**: Simplified life ahead

Your marketing must acknowledge and address these emotions.

## Messaging That Resonates

### Language That Works

✅ "Simplify"

❌ Anything patronizing or age-focused

### Sample Messaging

**For Sellers**:
