Nothing showcases a property's full potential like aerial photography. **Drone photography for real estate** reveals lot size, neighbourhood context, and proximity to amenities in ways ground-level photos simply cannot. For Ontario agents listing properties with notable lots, waterfront access, or scenic locations, drone imagery has become essential.

According to MLS data, listings with aerial photography receive 68% more views than those without. For properties where location and outdoor space are selling points, that advantage is even greater.

## Why Drone Photography Matters

### Visual Impact

Aerial photography captures:
- Full property scope and lot size
- Relationship to neighbours and privacy
- Backyard features (pools, gardens, patios)
- Proximity to parks, water, amenities
- Neighbourhood character and density

### Buyer Psychology

> "The drone shot sold me before I even walked through the door."

Aerial imagery helps buyers:
- Understand the property in context
- Appreciate lot size and outdoor space
- Visualize neighbourhood lifestyle
- Make faster initial judgments (positive or negative)

### Properties That Benefit Most

| Property Type | Drone Impact |
|:---|:---|
| Waterfront/Lakefront | Essential |
| Acreage/Rural | Essential |
| Properties with pools | High |
| Corner lots | High |
| Backing onto parks | High |
| Urban condos | Lower (focus on views) |
| Townhomes | Moderate |

## Canadian Drone Regulations

### Transport Canada Requirements

Before flying drones commercially in Canada, you must:

**Basic Operations** (lower risk):
- Pass Basic Pilot Certificate exam
- Fly only in uncontrolled airspace
- Keep drone below 122m (400ft)
- Maintain visual line of sight

**Advanced Operations** (required near airports, people):
- Pass Advanced Pilot Certificate exam
- Fly Transport Canada-certified drone
- Can operate in controlled airspace (with authorization)
- Can fly near people

### Real Estate Implications

Most real estate drone work requires **Advanced certification** because:
- Properties often near airports (GTA especially)
- Neighbours may be in proximity
- Controlled airspace covers much of southern Ontario

### Getting Certified

1. Study Transport Canada materials (free online)
2. Pass online exam ($10 fee)
3. For Advanced: Complete flight review with certified examiner
4. Register your drone
5. Carry proof of certification while flying

Time investment: 20-40 hours of study + flight practice

### Insurance Requirements

Commercial drone operators should carry:
- Liability insurance ($1-2M minimum)
- Proof often required for permits
- Some brokerages require coverage

## Hiring Professional Drone Operators

### What to Look For

✅ Transport Canada certification (ask for number)
✅ Liability insurance (ask for certificate)
✅ Real estate portfolio (quality varies widely)
✅ Professional editing included
✅ Quick turnaround (24-48 hours ideal)

### Cost Expectations

| Service | GTA Price Range |
|:---|:---|
| Drone photos only | $150-300 |
| Drone + ground photos | $300-500 |
| Drone video | $200-350 |
| Full package (photos + video + ground) | $500-800 |
| Luxury property package | $1,000+ |

### Questions to Ask

- "Can I see examples of your real estate work?"
- "What's your turnaround time?"
- "How many images/minutes of video included?"
- "Do you have controlled airspace authorization?"
- "What happens if weather delays the shoot?"

## Best Practices for Great Drone Shots

### Timing

**Best Times**:
- Golden hour (sunrise/sunset) for dramatic lighting
- Midday for sharp shadows and clear detail
- Overcast days for even lighting (no harsh shadows)

**Worst Times**:
- High noon in summer (harsh, flat lighting)
- Low sun angle in winter (long shadows, dim)
- Immediately after rain (wet surfaces, fog)

### Weather Considerations

**Ideal Conditions**:
- Light wind (under 15 km/h)
- No precipitation
- Good visibility
- Stable temperatures

**Cannot Fly**:
- Rain, snow, or fog
- High winds (over 30 km/h)
- Extreme cold (battery issues)

### Seasonal Tips

**Spring**: Capture fresh landscaping, avoid mud
**Summer**: Lush greenery, pool season, longest days
**Fall**: Foliage colours (spectacular in Ontario)
**Winter**: Property boundaries visible, unique appeal for year-round buyers

## Shot Composition

### Essential Angles

**1. Front Elevation** (45° angle)
- Shows front yard and house together
- Height: 15-20m
- Most common primary listing photo

**2. Overhead/Bird's Eye**
- Shows lot boundaries and layout
- Height: 30-50m
- Great for acreage properties

**3. Side Angles**
- Reveals depth of property
- Shows relationship to neighbours
- Captures side yards and access

**4. Backyard Focus**
- Pool, deck, garden features
- Privacy from neighbours
- Lower angle (10-15m)

**5. Neighbourhood Context**
- Higher altitude for surroundings
- Nearby amenities visible
- Location selling point

### Video Best Practices

**Standard Real Estate Drone Video**:
- 60-90 seconds total
- Smooth, slow movements
- Variety of heights and angles
- Musical soundtrack (licensed)
- Opening reveals property
- Closing with address/branding

**Movement Tips**:
- Slow and steady always
- Reveal shots (start behind, move forward)
- Orbit (circle the property)
- Top-down drop (high to low)
- Pull-back (close to wide)

## Editing and Delivery

### Photo Editing

Standard adjustments:
- Exposure and contrast balancing
- Colour correction for sky
- Lens distortion correction
- Horizon straightening
- Minor blemish removal (cars, garbage bins)

- Both landscape and square crops

**Video**:

## Restrictions and No-Fly Zones

### GTA Specific Challenges

The Greater Toronto Area has significant airspace restrictions:

- 5.6 km from Toronto Pearson = no drone zone without authorization
- Billy Bishop Airport impacts downtown Toronto
- Many private airports and heliports
- Protected areas (military, nuclear facilities)

### Checking Before You Fly

Use these resources:
- **NAV Drone app** (Transport Canada official)
- **AirMap** (comprehensive airspace info)
- **Drone Site Selection Tool** (Canada.ca)

### Controlled Airspace Authorization

If property is in controlled airspace:
1. Submit authorization request via NAV Drone
2. Allow 10+ days for processing
3. Receive flight clearance
4. Follow all conditions specified

For busy real estate schedules, work with photographers who already have blanket authorizations.

## Integrating Drone Content

**Cons**:

3. **Too much altitude** (property becomes unrecognizable dot)
4. **Shaky footage** (always use tripod mode, avoid wind)
5. **Ignoring neighbours** (privacy concerns, flying over property)
6. **Missing key features** (forget to capture pool, unique lot shape)
