**Facebook ads for real estate** remain one of the most cost-effective ways to generate buyer and seller leads in Ontario. While organic social media reach continues to decline, paid advertising on Facebook and Instagram allows you to reach precisely the right audience—people actively thinking about buying or selling homes in your market.

For GTA agents, effective Facebook advertising can mean the difference between struggling for leads and having a consistent pipeline of qualified prospects.

## Why Facebook Ads Work for Real Estate

### The Targeting Advantage

No other platform offers the granular targeting available through Meta's ad platform:

- **Geographic**: Target specific postal codes, cities, or radius around locations
- **Demographic**: Age, income (estimated), homeownership status, life events
- **Behavioural**: Recent movers, likely to move, home value interests
- **Custom audiences**: Your email list, website visitors, engaged users

### Cost-Effectiveness

| Lead Generation Method | Avg. Cost Per Lead (Ontario) |
|:---|:---|
| Zillow/Realtor.ca Ads | $20-50 |
| Google Ads | $30-80 |
| Facebook/Instagram | $5-25 |
| Direct Mail | $15-40 |

Facebook often delivers the lowest cost per lead for real estate, especially when well-optimized.

### Visual Platform + Visual Product

Real estate is inherently visual. Facebook and Instagram—both visual platforms—are natural fits for showcasing properties and lifestyle.

## Account Setup Best Practices

### Business Manager Structure

Before running ads, set up properly:

1. **Facebook Business Manager**: business.facebook.com
2. **Ad Account**: Link to your business
3. **Facebook Pixel**: Install on your website
4. **Conversion API**: For iOS 14+ tracking
5. **Connected Instagram**: Link your real estate Instagram

### Pixel Installation

The Facebook Pixel tracks website visitors and enables:
- Retargeting campaigns
- Lookalike audiences
- Conversion tracking
- Optimization for leads

If you're using a website builder, most have simple Pixel integration:
- WordPress: Use "PixelYourSite" plugin
- Squarespace: Built-in integration
- Wix: Facebook integration in marketing tools

## Campaign Types for Real Estate

### 1. Lead Generation Campaigns

**Objective**: Generate buyer/seller leads directly on Facebook

**Best For**: 
- Home value requests
- Buyer consultation signups

**Advantage**: Users never leave Facebook = higher conversion rates

**Lead Form Tips**:
- Keep questions minimal (name, email, phone)
- Add 1-2 qualifying questions
- Use pre-filled fields when possible
- Include privacy notice for CASL compliance

### 2. Traffic Campaigns

**Objective**: Drive users to your website or landing page

**Best For**:

**Landing Page Requirements**:
- Mobile-optimized (80%+ of Facebook traffic is mobile)

## Ad Creative That Converts

### Image Ads

**Best Practices**:
- Real property photos outperform stock images
- Show lifestyle, not just rooms
- Avoid too much text on image (<20% rule is gone but still recommended)
- Include address or neighbourhood for local relevance

**Sizing**:
- Feed: 1080x1080 (square) or 1200x628 (landscape)
- Stories: 1080x1920 (9:16)
- Always upload highest resolution

### Video Ads

- Hook in first 3 seconds
- Subtitles essential (85% watch without sound)
- End with clear CTA

**Talking Head Videos**:
- Personal connection
- Market updates
- Tips and advice
- 30-60 seconds

### Carousel Ads

**Multiple Properties**:
- Feature 3-5 listings
- Each card = one property
- Final card = CTA

**Property Features**:
- Card 1: Exterior
- Card 2: Kitchen
- Card 3: Primary bedroom
- Card 4: Backyard
- Card 5: Location/neighbourhood

### Copy Framework

**Hook** (stop the scroll):
- Question: "Thinking of selling your [Neighbourhood] home?"
- Statement: "Just Listed: Stunning 4BR in [Area]"
- Number: "3 reasons [Neighbourhood] home values are rising"

**Body** (deliver value):
- Address main desire or pain point
- Include key property features or benefits
- Social proof if applicable

**CTA** (direct action):
- "Request your free home evaluation"
- "See all photos and virtual tour"
- "Book a private showing this weekend"

**Example**:
> 🏡 Just Listed in Leaside—and it won't last!
>
> This stunning 3BR semi features:
> ✓ Updated kitchen with quartz counters
> ✓ Finished basement with rec room
> ✓ Private backyard with deck
> ✓ Steps to Leaside Village shops & restaurants
>
> Listed at $1,499,000 | Open House Sunday 2-4 PM
>

## Budget and Bidding Strategy

### Budget Recommendations

| Campaign Type | Min. Daily Budget | Optimal Daily |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Lead Gen | $25 | $50-100 |
| Just Listed | $15 | $30-50 |
| Awareness/Farming | $10 | $25-40 |
| Retargeting | $10 | $20-30 |

### Bidding Strategies

**Start With**: Lowest cost (let Facebook optimize)

**Advanced**: Cost cap (set max cost per lead you'll accept)

**Testing Budget**:
Allow $200-500 to test ad creative before scaling winners.

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Benchmark (Real Estate) |
|:---|:---|
| Click-Through Rate (CTR) | 0.8-1.5% |
| Cost Per Click (CPC) | $0.50-2.00 |
| Cost Per Lead (CPL) | $5-25 |
| Lead Form Conversion | 10-25% |

### Lead Quality Indicators

Not all leads are equal. Track:
- Phone connection rate
- Appointment booking rate
- Qualification rate (timeline, pre-approval)
- Conversion to client

A $5 lead that never answers is worth less than a $25 lead who's pre-approved and motivated.

## CASL and RECO Compliance

### CASL (Canadian Anti-Spam Law)

When collecting leads through Facebook:
- Clear consent before marketing emails
- State how you'll use their information
- Easy unsubscribe in all communications
- Keep consent records

### RECO Compliance

All real estate advertising must:
- Include brokerage name
- Include agent registration number
- Not be misleading
- Follow advertising guidelines

Ensure your landing pages and lead forms include required disclosures.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Audience Too Broad
❌ "All people in Ontario aged 20-65"
✅ "Homeowners in specific postal codes, aged 35-55, interested in real estate"

### 2. Giving Up Too Soon
Allow 3-5 days for the algorithm to optimize before judging performance.

### 3. Ignoring Lead Follow-Up
Facebook leads are "warm"—they need follow-up within 5 minutes for best results.

### 4. Same Ad Forever
Refresh creative every 2-4 weeks to avoid ad fatigue.

### 5. No Retargeting
80% of leads need multiple touchpoints. Retargeting captures the return visitors.

## Advanced Strategies

### Lookalike Audiences

Create audiences similar to your:
- Past buyers (source email list)
- Past sellers
- Website converters
- Video viewers (highly engaged)

Start with 1% lookalike (most similar), expand to 2-5% for reach.

### Dynamic Ads for Real Estate

Connect your MLS feed to Facebook for automated listing ads:
- Each listing becomes an ad automatically
- Retarget users with properties they viewed
- Reduce creative production time

Requires Facebook Catalog setup and MLS integration.
