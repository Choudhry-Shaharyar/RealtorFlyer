Real estate investors are the most data-driven, repeat-transaction clients you can serve. They buy based on numbers, not emotions, and successful ones keep buying. Mastering **investment property marketing** means speaking their language: cash flow, cap rates, appreciation potential, and ROI.

Ontario's rental market—driven by immigration, housing supply constraints, and rising rents—creates consistent investor demand. Agents who understand and market to this segment build transaction volume that compounds over time.
