Summer in Ontario means peak real estate season. Longer days, beautiful landscaping, and motivated buyers create the perfect conditions for selling homes. But standing out during this competitive period requires intentional **summer real estate marketing strategies** that capitalize on the season's unique advantages.

From June through August, you have approximately 90 days to maximize listings, close deals, and build momentum for the rest of the year. Here's how to make every summer day count.

## Why Summer is Prime Selling Season

### The Numbers Don't Lie

| Month | Avg. GTA Sales Volume | Days on Market |
|:---|:---|:---|
| June | 9,200+ | 14 |
| July | 8,800+ | 16 |
| August | 7,600+ | 17 |
| December | 3,200+ | 28 |

Summer brings nearly 3x the transaction volume of winter months, with significantly faster sales.

### Summer Buyer Psychology

Why summer buying intensifies:
- **School calendar**: Families want to move before September
- **Weather**: Easier to view properties and visualize living there
- **Landscaping**: Homes show best with mature gardens
- **Relocation timing**: Corporate moves often align with summer

## Outdoor Photography Excellence

### Capturing Curb Appeal

Summer provides the perfect backdrop—use it wisely:

**Morning shoots (7-9 AM):**
- Soft, directional light
- Dew on grass adds sparkle
- Fewer people and cars

**Evening shoots (6-8 PM):**
- Golden hour warmth
- Long shadows add depth
- Lifestyle vibes for decks/patios

### Must-Capture Summer Features

Ensure your photography includes:
- Front garden in full bloom
- Backyard entertaining areas
- Pool or water features
- Deck/patio staged for outdoor dining
- Mature trees providing shade
- Views of any green space

> Homes photographed with lush summer landscaping sell 18% faster than those with brown grass or bare gardens.

### Dealing with Harsh Midday Light

If you must shoot between 10 AM-4 PM:
- Use flash fill for shadowed areas
- Shoot interior rooms instead
- Edit for balanced exposure
- Consider HDR techniques
