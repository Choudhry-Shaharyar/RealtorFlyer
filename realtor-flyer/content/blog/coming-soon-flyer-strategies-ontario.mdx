In Ontario's competitive real estate market, the days before your listing hits MLS can be just as important as the launch itself. A well-executed **coming soon real estate flyer** campaign builds anticipation, attracts serious buyers, and positions your property for a strong debut—often resulting in multiple offers and above-asking sales.

But coming soon marketing in Ontario requires careful navigation of OREA and RECO guidelines. Done right, it's a powerful tool. Done wrong, it can create compliance headaches.

## Why "Coming Soon" Works in Ontario Markets

The psychology behind coming soon marketing is simple: scarcity creates urgency.

When potential buyers see that a property is "coming soon," they feel they're getting early access to something exclusive. In the GTA, where desirable properties can receive 10+ offers within days of listing, this early positioning matters tremendously.

### Benefits of Coming Soon Campaigns

1. **Pre-qualified buyer pool**: Identify serious interest before the MLS race begins
2. **Testing price response**: Gauge market reaction before committing to a list price
3. **Neighbourhood buzz**: Alert potential sellers in the area that the market is active
4. **Reduced days on market**: Properties with coming soon campaigns often report faster sales
5. **Seller satisfaction**: Demonstrates proactive marketing to your clients

## OREA Compliance: What Ontario Agents Need to Know

Before launching any coming soon campaign in Ontario, understand the regulatory framework:

### Key OREA Guidelines

1. **Seller consent**: Document your seller's agreement to pre-MLS marketing
2. **Listing agreement**: Must be in place before any public advertising
3. **MLS timeline**: Understand your board's rules on exclusive listings
4. **Price advertising**: Be careful with price indications before MLS entry
5. **Fair dealing**: Ensure all potential buyers have equal opportunity

### RECO Considerations

The Real Estate Council of Ontario requires:
- Accurate representation of the property
- No misleading claims about availability or exclusivity
- Proper disclosure to all parties
- Documented seller instructions for marketing approach

When in doubt, consult your broker of record.

## Anatomy of a High-Converting Coming Soon Flyer

### 1. Mystery and Intrigue

Unlike a just listed flyer, your coming soon shouldn't reveal everything. Create curiosity:

**Too Much:**
> "4 Bed, 3 Bath, 2,500 sq ft, $1,299,000"

**Just Right:**
> "Stunning 4-Bedroom Family Home Coming to Forest Hill"
> "Be First to Know When This Sells"

### 2. Exclusive Access Positioning

Make recipients feel special:
- "Priority Preview List"
- "Register for Early Access"
- "VIP Buyer Alert"

### 3. Timeline Teaser

Create urgency without being misleading:
- "Hitting MLS in 7 Days"
- "Open House Coming January 21-22"
- "Offers Expected Late January"

### 4. Strong Visual Appeal

Even with limited photos (some sellers prefer privacy before launch), use:
- Neighbourhood street scenes
- Architectural detail shots
- Lifestyle imagery that represents the area
- Your professional branding

### 5. Clear Call to Action

What should recipients do?
- "Text 'PREVIEW' to 416-XXX-XXXX"
- "Scan to Join the Priority List"
- "Reply to This Email for Details"

## Coming Soon Templates for Different Ontario Markets

### Template 1: Luxury Exclusives (Oakville, Forest Hill, Rosedale)

**Messaging Approach:** Understated elegance, privacy, discretion

> **Coming Soon**
> *Bridle Path*
>
> An exceptional residence on one of Toronto's most prestigious streets.
> 
> By Private Appointment Only
> 
> [Agent Name] • [Phone]

Minimal details. Maximum intrigue. This works for high-net-worth buyers who appreciate discretion.

### Template 2: First-Time Buyer Opportunities (Brampton, Hamilton, Oshawa)

**Messaging Approach:** Accessible, exciting, opportunity-focused

>
> 3-Bedroom Semi Under $650,000

## Distribution Strategy for Coming Soon Campaigns

### Tier 1: Inner Circle (Immediate)
- Existing buyer clients who match the property
- Other agents in your brokerage with matched buyers
- Personal network (past clients, sphere of influence)

### Tier 2: Neighbourhood (3-5 Days Before MLS)
- Door hangers on the same street
- Neighbours may know buyers interested in the area
- Creates local buzz

### Tier 3: Market at Large (When Appropriate)
- Social media announcements
- Email blast to full database
- Agent-to-agent networking

### The Power of Controlled Release

Strategic agents control the information flow:

**Day 1-3:** Inner circle only
**Day 4-5:** Neighbourhood flyer drop
**Day 6:** Social media tease
**Day 7:** MLS goes live with full marketing blitz

## Digital Tools for Coming Soon Success

### Landing Page + Lead Capture

Create a simple landing page for your coming soon property:
- Property teaser
- Registration form
- Auto-response with next steps

Services like Mailchimp, HubSpot, or even a simple Google Form can capture interested buyers who you can contact the moment the listing goes live.

### Social Media Teasers

The coming soon phase is perfect for suspense-building content:
- Day 1: "Something special is coming to [Neighbourhood]..."
- Day 3: "Sneak peek: Chef's kitchen in an upcoming listing..."
- Day 5: "48 hours until the big reveal..."
- Day 7: "NOW LIVE: [Address]—Link in bio"

## Common Coming Soon Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Advertising Without a Signed Listing Agreement

This is a serious RECO violation. Never, ever advertise a property—even as "coming soon"—without a proper listing agreement in place.

### Mistake 2: Promising Exclusive Access You Can't Deliver

If you say "VIP Preview," you better deliver something special. Don't frustrate buyers with empty promises.

### Mistake 3: Going "Coming Soon" for Too Long

A coming soon campaign should last 5-10 days maximum. Beyond that, buyers wonder what's wrong. The urgency evaporates.

### Mistake 4: Revealing Too Much

The goal is curiosity, not complete disclosure. Save the full feature sheet for the MLS launch.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting the Follow-Up

Collecting registrations means nothing if you don't follow up. The moment the property goes live, those registered buyers should get a personal call or email immediately.

## Measuring Coming Soon Campaign Success

Track these metrics to improve future campaigns:

- **Registration rate**: How many people signed up for updates
- **Registration-to-showing conversion**: Did registrants actually tour?
- **Early buyer identification**: Were any registrants ultimately the buyer?
- **Neighbourhood lead generation**: Seller leads from the campaign
- **Days on market comparison**: Coming soon vs. direct-to-MLS listings

## Automating Your Coming Soon Marketing

Creating professional coming soon flyers traditionally requires:
1. Design work before you even have all the photos
2. Multiple versions as the timeline updates
3. Quick turnaround as the MLS date approaches
